# GTPNutriCount Image Analyzer

GPTNutriCount Image Analyzer assists users in counting calories and macronutrients based on photos of their meals and drinks consumed throughout the day.

This command-line tool, given an input folder as an argument, recursively iterates through sub-folders searching for single image files and groupped image files in folders named Item... There are single photos of food items in the input folder and groupped photos of food items in the Item folders. Groupped photos depict the same item in different orientations. Supported photo formats include .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif, etc. 

GPTNutriCount Image Analyzer works on Python 3.11.

The tool creates a file named NutriCountEstimate__....json next to each item, provided the file does not yet exist. The NutriCountEstimate__....json file includes the following fields, with estimated values based on the images of the food item:
{
    "InformalFoodName": "Apple, Red, Medium Sized",
    "KiloCaloriesPerItem": 95.0,
    "WeightGramsPerItem": 200.0,
    "CarbohydrateGramsPerItem": 25.0,
    "FiberGramsPerItem": 4.0,
    "FatGramsPerItem": 0.0,
    "ProteinGramsPerItem": 0.5,
    "NumberOfItemConsumed": 1.0
}


The contents of the JSON file are estimated through a request to GPT-4. If an Item folder contains several photos, each photo is uploaded in the same OpenAI API request, with the following prompt:

"You are a nutritionist, tasked with digitalizing nutritional values of a specific food or drink item. The attached image(s) depict(s) one particular food or drink item. Your job is to provide the fields for this item as shown in the examples below.
You MUST answer in JSON format only.
The field names MUST be InformalFoodName, KiloCaloriesPerItem, WeightGramsPerItem, CarbohydrateGramsPerItem, FiberGramsPerItem, FatGramsPerItem, ProteinGramsPerItem, and NumberOfItemConsumed.
If the serving size is known, you MUST assume the consumption, weight, and nutritive value for one serving.


### Example of an Apple:

{
    "InformalFoodName": "Apple, Red, Medium Sized",
    "KiloCaloriesPerItem": 95.0,
    "WeightGramsPerItem": 200.0,
    "CarbohydrateGramsPerItem": 25.0,
    "FiberGramsPerItem": 4.0,
    "FatGramsPerItem": 0.0,
    "ProteinGramsPerItem": 0.5,
    "NumberOfItemConsumed": 1.0
}

### Example of a 33 grams Serving:

{
    "InformalFoodName": "100% Vegan Protein Powder",
    "KiloCaloriesPerItem": 131.0,
    "WeightGramsPerItem": 33.0,
    "CarbohydrateGramsPerItem": 0.6,
    "FiberGramsPerItem": 0.0,
    "FatGramsPerItem": 2.6,
    "ProteinGramsPerItem": 24.0,
    "NumberOfItemConsumed": 1.0
}

### Example of Nutritional Values per 100 grams:

{
    "InformalFoodName": "Almond Milk, Mediterranean",
    "KiloCaloriesPerItem": 26.0,
    "WeightGramsPerItem": 100.0,
    "CarbohydrateGramsPerItem": 0.4,
    "FiberGramsPerItem": 0.4,
    "FatGramsPerItem": 1.1,
    "ProteinGramsPerItem": 0.5,
    "NumberOfItemConsumed": 1.0
}
